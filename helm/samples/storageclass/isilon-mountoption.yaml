# This is a sample manifest for utilizing the mount options.
# PVCs created using this storage class will be scheduled 
# only on the nodes with access to Isilon

# Provide mount options through "mountOptions" attribute 
# to create PVCs with mount options.

  # When a PVC is being created, it takes the storage class' value of "storageclass.rootClientEnabled", 
  # which  determines, when a node mounts the PVC, in NodeStageVolume, whether to add the k8s node to 
  # the "Root clients" field (when true) or "Clients" field (when false) of the NFS export 
  RootClientEnabled: "false"
  # Name of PowerScale cluster where pv will be provisioned
  # This name should match with name of one of the cluster configs in isilon-creds secret
  # If this parameter is not specified, then default cluster config in isilon-creds secret will be considered if available
  #ClusterName: "<cluster_name>"

# volumeBindingMode controls when volume binding and dynamic provisioning should occur.
# Immediate mode indicates that volume binding and dynamic provisioning occurs once the PersistentVolumeClaim is created
# WaitForFirstConsumer mode will delay the binding and provisioning of a PersistentVolume
# until a Pod using the PersistentVolumeClaim is created
